Documented changes in dominion.c:
1.) Five cards were chosen to refactor. The cards were smithy, village, remodel, council_room, and embargo.
2.) Five functions declarations were made to accommodate for the refactoring of the five cards. The functions were named smithyCardEffect(), villageCardEffect(), remodelCardEffect(), councilRoomCardEffect(), and embargoCardEffect().
3.) The definition of the smithyCardEffect() function was copied from the switch statement with the 'smithy' case.
4.) The parameters given to smithyCardEffect() were int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, and int handPos. These were given based on what was used in the function definition.
5.) Declared i as an integer at the beginning of the function.
6.) The definition of the villageCardEffect() function was copied from the switch statement with the 'village' case.
7.) The parameters given to villageCardEffect() were int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, and int handPos. These were given based on what was used in the function definition.
8.) The definition of the remodelCardEffect() function was copied from the switch statement with the 'remodel' case.
9.) The parameters given to remodelCardEffect() were int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, int choice1, int choice2, int handPos, and int j. These were given based on what was used in the function definition.
10.) Declared i as an integer at the beginning of the function.
11.) The definition of the councilRoomCardEffect() function was copied from the switch statement with the 'council_room' case.
12.) The parameters given to councilRoomCardEffect() were int currentPlayer, struct gameState *state, and int handPos. These were given based on what was used in the function definition.
13.) Declared i as an integer at the beginning of the function.
14.) The definition of the embargoCardEffect() function was copied from the switch statement with the 'embargo' case.
15.) The parameters given to embargoCardEffect() were struct gameState *state, int choice1, int handPos, and int currentPlayer. These were given based on what was used in the function definition.
16.) Add the respective function call in the switch statement within each case '(card)' that was refactored.
