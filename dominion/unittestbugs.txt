While writing my unit tests, I did not face any unexpected
outcomes. In unit test 1, I had the first player purchase
a card, which worked without fail. I had the second player
purchase a card, and try to buy another. The second one failed
because the player did not have enough coins. Similar to the
first one, the remaining tests were designed to test several
functions of the code. Any bugs within these files are purposely
placed to test the game for wrong input or invalid functions.
