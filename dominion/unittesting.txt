Assignment 2

As part of this assignment, we were tasked with running
gcov on our dominion.c file after implementing our tests.
After running my tests, gcov returned a coverage of 
34.95% out of 558 lines. This suggests that the tests I
ran on the dominion code covered roughly 1/3 of the entire
document. I was surprised to find that a total of eight 
tests taken throughout the source code would yield such
a high coverage percentage. For unit test 1, I tested
whether a player can buy a card, as well as what happens
when a player tries to buy but shouldn't be able to. For
unit test 2, I tested whether the numHandCards function
works, but testing player's hands against what they were
supposed to have. For unit test 3, I tested whether the 
endTurn and whoseTurn functions work by repeatedly
taking turns and checking which player is playing. For
unit test 4, I tested the shuffle function. In this, I
tested whether or not the deck of cards was shuffled.
For the card tests, I tested the effects of the village,
baron, cutpurse, and adventurer cards.

As mentioned in the unittestbugs.txt, the tests went well
overall. The only bugs found were the ones intentionally
implemented in order to test the system.

The implementation of the unit tests depended heavily on
my knowledge of the game. I had to go back to the rules
several times and refresh my knowledge. I also studied
the source code for a while before starting to test it.
The hardest part of this was understanding what someone 
else was doing without much commenting throughout. The
card test implementations were simpler, as I was only
testing the effects of specific cards, not a whole function
of the game.
