Bug Report 1

Bug: councilRoomCard() did not behave correctly.

The implementation of the councilRoomCard() function deals out cards
to each of the players in the game. As stated by the Dominion Game
Rules, when the council room card is played, "the other players must 
draw a card whether they want to or not." This does not include the
current player.

This can be easily fixed by adding an if statement, such as

	if(i != currentPlayer){
		drawCard(i, state);
	}


Severity: Medium
This bug added one extra card to the current player. This would not
yield accurate results for the end of the game, but is not completely
detrimental.

Priority: Medium
Since this bug is not detrimental to the game and does not require a
lot of time to fix, I think the priority is medium. When fixed, it will
yield the correct results, but the game will still run with it present.
