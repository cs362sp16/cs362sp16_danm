Bug: numHandCards() failure in Unit Test 2

Unit Test 2 checks to see if the numHandCards() function works
correctly given different players and cards played. When
performing these tests on my dominion source code, I found that
the function returned the correct values.

The bug I found in Pranav's source code is that the function
will not return the correct value after a turn has ended. The
card count for Player 1 is succesful, while the card count for
Player 2 returns an error.

I was not able to pinpoint the source of this problem, as the
numHandCards() function behaves correctly in the other tests I
have performed.


Severity: Low
This only affects the ability to check how many cards are in a
player's hand. While this may be annoying, it is not detrimental
to the game play, meaning the game could still be played. 

Priority: Low
This is something that can be discovered and fixed in later testing,
the main focus should be on making sure the currency is kept track of
correctly.
