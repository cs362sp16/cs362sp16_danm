Bug Report 3

Bug: buyCard() if statement logic mistake

Unit Test 1 checks to see if the buyCard() function works
properly, allowing the user to buy only if they have enough
currency. 

The function returned "You do not have enough money to buy 
that. You have X coins." The bug here was that the X amount
was greater than the cost of the card.

The line that caused this was 

	else if (state->coins > getCost(supplyPos))

The decision sign > is facing the wrong way. This statement
would always be triggered if the current player had more
than enough coins to purchase the desired card. The fix is
to flip the decision sign to be less than the cost of the
desired card.

	else if (state->coins < getCost(supplyPos))


Severity: High
This bug would not allow the player to buy a card even though
they had enough currency to do so. This would throw off the
game play and yield bad game results.

Priority: High
Since this is an easy fix to something that is very important
to the game play, it should be prioritized highly. Fixing this
will allow for players to be able to purchase cards.
